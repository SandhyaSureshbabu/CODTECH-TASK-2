OVERVIEW:

1. Preprocessing Image Data
Preprocessing is essential to ensure the images are in a suitable format for training. Steps include resizing, normalization, and converting to tensors.

2. Data Augmentation
Data augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training dataset, improving the model's generalization. Common augmentation techniques include:

Random cropping
Horizontal flipping
Rotation
Color jittering

3. Designing the CNN Architecture
A typical CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU).
Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps (e.g., MaxPooling).
Fully Connected Layers: Perform the final classification.

4. Training the Model
Using a dataset like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, we train the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss).

5. Transfer Learning
Utilize pretrained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet) to leverage already learned features, fine-tuning the model on our specific dataset for better performance.
